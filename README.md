# Fixit App

This is an app I have created and am currently working on.

**Project idea:**  
Users can log in or create an account. Then, they can choose a category, for example Electrician or Plumber, and then select a subcategory.

After choosing a subcategory, the user can see all other users who belong to the same subcategory with all their information. This way, the user can contact the person or company that can help them.

The app is designed to make it easier for users to connect with different service providers.
