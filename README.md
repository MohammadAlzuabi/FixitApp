# Fixit App

## Overview

This application was created to help users register, create an account, and log in to find and connect with service providers.

## How It Works

- Users can **register** and **log in**.
- After logging in, users can **contact an admin**.
- If a user is a **self-employed professional** (such as a freelancer or business owner), the admin assigns a special **role** to them.
- Self-employed users can then fill in their profile with details like:
  - Name
  - Address
  - Phone number
  - Category (e.g., Electrician, Plumber)
  - Subcategory

## User Experience

- Users looking for help can browse service providers by category and subcategory.
- For example, if a user has an electrical issue, they can select the **Electrician** category and relevant subcategory.
- They will see contact information (phone, address, etc.) of available professionals.
- Users can then reach out directly to these self-employed service providers to arrange assistance.

## Purpose

The app aims to make it easy for people to find the right service providers based on their specific needs and to facilitate direct contact between users and professionals.
